# Inventory-Portal

Welcome to Inventory-Portal, a webapp designed to act as a contact point between a supplying company and its vendors. Our app is built using the latest in web development technologies such as ReactJS, NodeJS, ExpressJS, and MySQL, ensuring a seamless user experience for both the suppliers and vendors. The app allows vendors to view all available products at their fingertips, with the ability to create a personalized shopping cart and generate a bill in a matter of clicks. On the other hand, the supplying company has access to admin privileges, including the ability to delete products, add new products, and even delete users. In addition, the supplying company also has access to a comprehensive dashboard that provides valuable insights into their stock, such as how many products they have and the total cost of all items. With this information, they can make informed decisions that will positively impact their business.
